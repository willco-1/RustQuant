/// This determines the number of days between two coupon payments,
/// thus calculating the amount transferred on payment dates and also the
/// accrued interest for dates between payments. The day count is also
/// used to quantify periods of time when discounting a cash-flow to its
/// present value. When a security such as a bond is sold between interest
/// payment dates, the seller is eligible to some fraction of the coupon amount.
